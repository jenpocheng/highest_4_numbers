Find the highest 4 number in an unordered list
==============================================

Overview
--------
highest_k is a function that finds the highest k numbers in an unordered list 
of integers in O(k + nlogk) time. When k is constant, e.g. 4, the complexity 
is O(n).


Compiling and running the example
-----------------------------------
  cd src
  make
  ./highest_4


Unit testing
------------
Google C++ testing framework is used as the testing platform for unit testing. 
One example is included in the tests/testcases folder, and it tests three 
basic situations, including normal cases, edge cases, and exceptional cases.
To compile and see the results of the tests, run the following commands:

  cd tests
  make
  ./highest_n_unittest
